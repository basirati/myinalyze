Uploading a recorded dataset to my test instance got stuck at 0% and the time left kept increasing. After leaving the window open for a few hours, the Chrome tab froze and had to be refreshed.

After some investigation, the root cause of this problem appears to be that the sensor_frame.xml file was owned by another user without read/write permissions to group or others.
h2. Expected 
 * The upload process goes through without errors, or
 * If upload failed due to any reason, e.g. files being inaccessible, a graceful error message is displayed, so that the user can retry manually or fix the issue

h2. Steps To Reproduce:
 # Open the terminal and go to any recorded dataset
 # Change the ownership and permissions for the sensor_frame.xml file, so that it's owned by another user without read/write permissions to 'group' nor 'others':
 ## Execute `sudo chown gi23kuj sensor_frame.xml` 
 ## Execute `sudo chmod 700 sensor_frame.xml`
 # Go to your Proc on Cloud instance
 # Go to  Cloud Processing
 # Go to Uploaded Data
 # Click Upload recorded data
 # Select the dataset from step 1
 # Notice how the upload is initiated, but it gets stuck and the time left keeps increasing

 

Also, this might be irrelevant, but I noticed a few GET requests to https://cloud-processing-storage-manager.s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com that got a 404 response. It doesn't seem to be affecting the normal workflow when the upload is running normally, though.
